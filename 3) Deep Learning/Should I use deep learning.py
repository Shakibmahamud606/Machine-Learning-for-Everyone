Should I use deep learning?
You work for a bank and want to help your company make smarter loans. You'd like to predict the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on information in their application, such as their credit history, education level, income, and assets. This amount can then be used to determine the interest rate of the loan. You have hundreds of thousands of examples of loans from the past ten years.

For now, you just want to build a proof of concept on your laptop showing that there is some value in building this model. The performance doesn't have to be perfect just yet.

Based on this information, how should you solve this problem?
