Steps for building a model
Machine learning is integrated in many of the technologies we use everyday.
For example, have you noticed that platforms will have personalized recommendations,
whether it's another funny video on Youtube or a book by your favorite author on Amazon?
These are "recommender systems" and they typically consist of a machine learning model trained on a user's browsing history.

Imagine the recommender system of your favorite online clothing store.
They have data on all the clothes you've viewed and the clothes you ended up buying.
This is enough to make a model to output personalized clothing recommendation for you.
On the right are tasks to create this model, however, they are incorrectly ordered???


       1)Extract the features for each product in the shop, including brand, number of times viewed, cost, color, and clothing type.
       2)Split the dataset into 2/3 and 1/3 for the the train and test dataset, respectively
       3)Train the model using the train dataset and a logistic regression model
       4)Evaluate the percentage of products in the test dataset that were accurately predicted as bought
