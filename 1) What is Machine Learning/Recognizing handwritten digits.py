In machine learning, there's a famous dataset called the MNIST database of handwritten digits.
It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
Many models have been made using this dataset to enable computer recognition of handwritten digits.
 We have one of those models right here for you!

On the left-hand box, you can draw a digit (or something else!) and the model will try to infer the intended digit.
On the right, you will see the model's output. To draw a digit, click on plot to start drawing, click again to pause.
 What does the model's output represent?
