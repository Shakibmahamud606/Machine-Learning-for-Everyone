Have you heard of open data? These are datasets that are freely available and governments especially have been pushing initiatives for open public data.
For example, here is a snippet of a dataset from California's Open Data portal that looks at educational attainment (i.e., highest degree of education) and personal income.

Each row represents a Californian citizen. It contains the year the citizen completed the survey and the citizen's age, gender, educational attainment, and population count of where they live.

Which of the statements below incorrectly uses the term unsupervised or supervised learning?
